actual todo:
 no docs for rails? what?
 better searches
 add github
 updater


some 'main page' so you can navigate from gem to core easily
add in github gems, too :)
(note the emails better)

better domain (shared with someone else?)

add readme to the description [EM]

Gem core rdoc for Gem class? huh?

rdoc for gems that fail to build [?]

gems that fail their binary compile

better search either verbose or not

core docs should "have good files" (good start, good included)
core docs "include everything" (if helpful, would that help gems?)

general doc things:

files should say what classes were in themselves! rdoc crashes at times!

http://coredocs.faithpromotingstories.org/doc/ruby-1.8.6-p369/files/ruby-1_8_6-p369/lib/README.html is ugly

does ri work if a method is redefined?

shouldn't ri say *where* it got its info from? [some methods are from fileutils, etc.]


report "these break rdoc!" things
also does this?

D:\dev\downloads\eventmachine-0.12.8>rdoc README lib/* -mREADME --op=rdoc5
Parsing sources with 2 thread(s)...
Unrecognized directive 'a' in lib/fastfilereaderext.so

why doesn't my BigDecimal look as cool as the webri BigDecimal? huh?

newest gem, too

better layout for gembox page

Proc in core doesn't mention call like it should?
