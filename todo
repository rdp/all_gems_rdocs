hanna gem rdocs

better (conglom) core docs for the various versions
some 'main page' so you can navigate from gem to core easily
add an updater
add in github gems, too :)
(note the emails better)
better than a pre for the descriptions
do we use summaries?
note that you can somehow never have to install those annoying rdocs again [and ri if you never use it for gems anyway]
better domain (shared with someone else?)


Gem rdoc???

rdoc for gems that fail to build [?]

gems that fail their binary compile

better descriptions not just pre!


rdp@li49-39:~/gembox_bin/downloads$ ../gem rdoc eventmachine --no-ri
Installing RDoc documentation for eventmachine-0.12.8...
Could not find main page README
???

core docs should "have good files" (good start, good included)
core docs "include everything" (if so, would that help gems?)

github gems
