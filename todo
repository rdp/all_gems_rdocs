some 'main page' so you can navigate from gem to core easily
add an updater
add in github gems, too :)
(note the emails better)

better domain (shared with someone else?)

add readme to the description

Gem core rdoc for Gem class? huh?

rdoc for gems that fail to build [?]

gems that fail their binary compile


rdp@li49-39:~/gembox_bin/downloads$ ../gem rdoc eventmachine --no-ri
Installing RDoc documentation for eventmachine-0.12.8...
Could not find main page README
???

core docs should "have good files" (good start, good included)
core docs "include everything" (if so, would that help gems?)

github gems
